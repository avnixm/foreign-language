    culturalNotes: [
      "Respect for Others' Belongings: In Japan, personal belongings are treated with great respect. It's considered rude to touch or use someone else's item without permission, even if it looks like a shared space (e.g., an office or classroom).",
      "Asking Politely: When asking 'Whose is this?' (だれのですか), tone and politeness matter. Japanese people often use a soft and humble tone to avoid sounding intrusive. For example: これはどなたのですか。(Kore wa donata no desu ka?) → 'Whose is this?' (polite form using どなた instead of だれ)",
      "Labeling Belongings: In schools and companies, it's common to label personal items (like bags, notebooks, and lunch boxes) with names to prevent confusion — showing Japan's organized and community-conscious mindset.",
      "Lost and Found Culture: Japan is known for its honest and efficient lost-and-found system. If you lose something, it's likely to be returned to you — people will bring it to the kōban (police box) or station office instead of keeping it.",
      "Using 'no' (の) to Show Belonging: The particle の doesn't only express ownership — it also shows relationships or categories, such as: わたしのかばん (my bag), にほんのくるま (a Japanese car), がくせいのほん (a student's book).",
      "Transportation Etiquette: Japan has very punctual and efficient public transportation. The Shinkansen (bullet train) is famous for being on time to the second. It's important to queue properly and let passengers exit before boarding.",
      "Walking Culture: When someone says 'aruite' (歩いて - on foot), it reflects Japan's walkable cities. Many Japanese people walk or bike to stations, making it a healthy part of daily life.",
    ],
    tips: [
      "💡 Pronunciation Note: The particle へ is written as 'he' in hiragana but is always pronounced as 'e' (like the letter 'A') when used as a particle.",
      "📝 で vs へ: Remember that で (de) shows HOW you go (by train, by car), while へ (e) shows WHERE you're going (to Tokyo, to school).",
      "💡 Walking Exception: When walking somewhere, use あるいて (aruite) without the particle で. It's the only form of movement that doesn't use で!",
      "📝 Special Days: The first 10 days of the month have irregular readings (ついたち, ふつか, みっか, etc.). These are worth memorizing as they're used constantly in daily conversation.",
      "💡 いつ (When) Tip: Unlike other time words, いつ (itsu) usually doesn't take the particle に. You say 'いつ いきますか' not 'いつに いきますか'.",
      "📝 ひとりで Note: When doing something alone, use ひとりで (hitori de). The で here is different from the transportation で - it means 'by means of being alone'.",
      "💡 The よ Particle: Adding よ at the end of a sentence emphasizes that you're telling the listener something they don't know. It's like saying 'you know' or 'I'm telling you' in English.",
      "📝 Month Names: Months in Japanese are super easy! Just say the number + がつ (gatsu): 1月 (いちがつ), 2月 (にがつ), etc. The exception is April: 4月 (しがつ), not よんがつ.",
      "💡 と (with) vs も (too): Don't confuse と meaning 'with someone' with と meaning 'and' (for listing items). Context will tell you which one it is!",

    culturalNotes: [
      "Gift-Giving Culture (おみやげ文化): In Japan, gift-giving is an important part of social etiquette. People often bring small souvenirs (omiyage) when visiting someone or after traveling. It shows thoughtfulness and respect.",
      "Itadakimasu (いただきます): This phrase is said before eating as a form of thanks. It expresses gratitude to everyone who contributed to the meal - from the farmers to the cook.",
      "Entering Someone's Home: When entering a Japanese home, you typically say 'ごめんください' (gomenkudasai) to announce your presence. The host responds with 'いらっしゃい' (irasshai - welcome) or 'どうぞおあがりください' (dōzo oagari kudasai - please come in).",
      "Removing Shoes: In Japanese homes, you remove your shoes at the entrance (genkan). The host may provide slippers. This custom keeps the home clean and is deeply ingrained in Japanese culture.",
      "Complimenting with すてきですね: The word すてきですね (suteki desu ne) is a gentle and common way to compliment others. It's often used for clothes, homes, gifts, or anything aesthetically pleasing.",
      "Family Terms: Japanese has different words for family members depending on whether you're talking about your own family (humble forms) or someone else's family (polite forms). Use ちち/はは for your own parents, but おとうさん/おかあさん for others' parents.",
      "Lending and Borrowing: The distinction between lending (かします) and borrowing (かります) is important in Japanese culture, which values clear social obligations and reciprocity.",
    ],
    tips: [
      "💡 で Versatility: The particle で has multiple uses! It can mean 'with' (tool), 'by' (transportation), 'in' (language), or 'at' (location of action). Context tells you which meaning applies.",
      "📝 Family Terms: Use ちち (chichi) and はは (haha) when talking about YOUR OWN family to others. Use おとうさん (otōsan) and おかあさん (okāsan) when addressing or talking about SOMEONE ELSE'S family. This shows humility and respect.",
      "💡 あげます vs もらいます: Think of direction! あげます (agemasu) = give (away from you), もらいます (moraimasu) = receive (toward you). The subject changes depending on which verb you use!",
      "📝 に vs から for Receiving: Both に and から can mark the giver when you receive something. に is more common and neutral, while から emphasizes 'from' or the source.",
      "💡 もう vs まだ: もう (mō) = 'already' (used with positive statements), まだ (mada) = 'not yet' (used with negative or incomplete actions). Remember: もう finished, まだ waiting!",
      "📝 いかがですか Politeness: いかがですか is more polite than どうですか. Use it when offering something to guests or in formal situations. It shows extra respect and hospitality.",
      "💡 Katakana Office Items: Many office supplies use katakana loanwords, but ホッチキス (hotchikisu - stapler) is unique! It comes from the brand name 'Hotchkiss', an American stapler company.",
      "📝 ごめんください Usage: Use ごめんください when entering someone's home or shop. It's more polite than just knocking and shows you're waiting for permission to enter.",
      "💡 いただきます Meaning: いただきます doesn't just mean 'thank you for the meal.' The verb いただく means 'to humbly receive,' showing gratitude to all who made the meal possible - farmers, cooks, and even the ingredients themselves!",

    culturalNotes: [
      "Indirect Compliments: In Japanese culture, people tend to give indirect or modest compliments. Instead of directly saying someone is beautiful, they might say すてきですね (that's lovely) about their clothes or accessories.",
      "きれい (Kirei) Versatility: The word きれい can mean both 'beautiful/pretty' AND 'clean'. Context determines which meaning applies. This reflects Japanese values where cleanliness and beauty are closely connected.",
      "Color Symbolism: In Japan, colors carry cultural meaning. White (しろ) represents purity, red (あか) symbolizes energy and celebration, blue (あお) suggests calmness, and black (くろ) can represent formality or elegance.",
      "Food Descriptions: Japanese people often describe food in detail, noting not just taste but also texture, temperature, and appearance. Words like こい (strong flavor) and うすい (weak/light flavor) are commonly used.",
      "Modesty in Self-Description: When Japanese people describe themselves or their belongings, they often use modest language. They might say their home is ちいさい (small) even if it's average-sized, showing humility.",
      "やさしい Double Meaning: The word やさしい can mean both 'easy' (simple) and 'kind' (gentle, considerate). Context and kanji (優しい for kind, 易しい for easy) distinguish the meanings.",
      "Weather Talk: Discussing weather using adjectives like あつい (hot) and さむい (cold) is a common conversation starter in Japan, similar to Western cultures but often more detailed.",
      "いい vs よい: Both mean 'good', but いい is more casual and common in speech, while よい sounds more formal or literary. However, in conjugations, よい forms are standard (よかった, よくない).",
    ],
    tips: [
      "💡 Spotting Na-Adjectives: Not all words ending in い are i-adjectives! きれい, ゆうめい, きらい (dislike), and きれい are na-adjectives even though they end in い. When in doubt, check if it needs な before a noun.",
      "📝 いい Exception: The adjective いい (good) is irregular! Its negative is よくない, its past is よかった, and its て-form is よくて. It's the only adjective with this irregularity, so memorize these forms!",
      "💡 Color as I-Adjectives: All basic colors in Japanese are i-adjectives (あかい, あおい, etc.), so they follow i-adjective conjugation rules. Remember: あかくない (not red), あかかった (was red).",
      "📝 あまり + Negative: The word あまり (not very) MUST be used with negative forms. Never say *あまりおいしいです. Always say あまりおいしくないです. This is a very common mistake!",
      "💡 たかい Double Meaning: たかい means both 'expensive' AND 'tall/high'. The context tells you which: たかいビル (tall building), たかいくるま (expensive car).",
      "📝 Na-Adjective Conjugation: Na-adjectives conjugate like nouns! They use です/じゃありません/でした/じゃありませんでした. Think of them as 'noun-like adjectives'.",
      "💡 Temperature Words: あつい (hot) is for weather/atmosphere, but つめたい (cold) is for things you touch. For weather cold, use さむい. Don't mix them up!",
      "📝 Connecting Adjectives: To say 'X and Y', change い to くて for i-adjectives (おおきくて) and な to で for na-adjectives (きれいで). This creates smooth, natural descriptions!",
      "💡 どんな Usage: どんな always comes before a noun. You can't say *どんなですか alone. You must say どんな + [noun] + ですか, like どんなひとですか (what kind of person).",
      "📝 Taste Vocabulary: Japanese has very specific taste words. からい means 'spicy/hot' (like chili), not 'salty'. For salty, use しおからい. For spicy-hot temperature, use あつい!",

    culturalNotes: [
      "Location Awareness: In Japan, location and spatial awareness are very important for giving directions. Japanese speakers often describe things relative to landmarks using position words. This reflects a society where precision and consideration for others is valued.",
      "Kissaten Culture: きっさてん (kissaten) refers to traditional Japanese coffee shops, different from modern cafes. They often have a retro atmosphere, serve coffee from siphons, and offer light meals. They're quieter spaces for conversation or reading.",
      "Prefecture System: Japan is divided into 47 prefectures (県 - ken). When discussing locations, specifying the prefecture helps pinpoint where something is. For example, Tokyo Disneyland is actually in Chiba Prefecture, not Tokyo!",
      "Polite Direction-Giving: When giving directions in Japan, people often use humble language and may even walk with you part of the way to ensure you find your destination. This shows the cultural value of おもてなし (omotenashi - hospitality).",
      "Relative Positioning: Japanese uses relative position words extensively. Unlike Western maps that focus on cardinal directions (N/S/E/W), Japanese often describes locations relative to known landmarks or objects, making position words essential.",
      "Store Layout Descriptions: Japanese stores often have clear spatial organization. Terms like おく (back), がわ (side), and だんめ (shelf level) are commonly used by staff to help customers find products efficiently.",
      "Plants and Trees: While き (tree) is inanimate and uses あります, the distinction shows how Japanese categorizes living vs. non-living differently from animate vs. inanimate. Trees are living but don't move, so they use あります.",
    ],
    tips: [
      "💡 Memory Trick for います/あります: Think of います for things that can 'move around' (people, animals) and あります for things that 'stay put' (objects, buildings). This helps you remember which verb to use!",
      "📝 Plants Use あります: Even though plants are alive, they use あります, not います! Trees (き), flowers (はな), and all plants use あります because they don't move around like animals do.",
      "💡 が vs は Distinction: Use が when introducing NEW information (何がありますか - What is there?). Use は when talking about something KNOWN (ほんやはどこですか - Where is the bookstore?).",
      "📝 に Marks Location: The particle に always marks where something exists. Think: 'に = at/in/on' for location. へやに (in the room), こうえんに (in the park).",
      "💡 Position Words Need の: Always use の between the reference object and position word: つくえのうえ (on the desk), いすのした (under the chair). Don't forget the の!",
      "📝 や vs と: Use と when listing complete items (AとB = A and B, that's all). Use や when giving examples (AやB = A and B, among others). や suggests there's more not mentioned!",
      "💡 Shelf Counting: したから (from bottom) is more common than うえから (from top) when describing shelf positions in stores, as people naturally count from the bottom up when looking at shelves.",
      "📝 あそこ vs そこ vs ここ: あそこ (over there - far from both), そこ (there - near listener), ここ (here - near speaker). Match with その/あの/この for 'that/that/this'!",
      "💡 Double に Pattern: You'll often see 'Place に Object が います/あります' with に appearing twice: 'へやに つくえのうえに ほんが あります' (In the room, on the desk, there's a book). The first に marks the general location, the second marks the specific position!",
      "📝 〜がわ (Side): When combined with directions, がわ becomes essential: みぎがわ (right side), ひだりがわ (left side). It's like saying 'right-hand side' in English.",
